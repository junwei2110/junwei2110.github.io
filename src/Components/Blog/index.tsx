            <h3>To my dearest,</h3>

            <p>
                When you are reading this, you are either waiting for the plane 
                or in the plane already. I always wanted to share how much you
                mean to me, but I am not the best with words, so I hope my feelings
                can reach you better this way. 
            </p>

            <p>
                First and foremost, happy birthday dear! This will be the 2nd birthday
                that I will be sharing with you, and while I may not be there physically,
                I hope you will be able to feel my well wishes spiritually. I wish you 
                all the success in your career endeavours, continue to enjoy life and 
                have good health. I know you are strong-willed and you will do your best
                in whatever you set out to achieve. Enjoy your birthday with your family!
                I know you have missed them dearly.
            </p>

                I know we have talked about you leaving for Australia many times already,
                but I just want you to know that I understand your position. Your family is
                situated there, and it is not fair for me to request you to leave them and stay
                with me. I fully support your decision to move back there. While we may feel 
                somewhat uncertain about our relationship, I am not worried. I believe that our
                relationship has the strength and maturity to push through this LDR. Sure, there
                will be sacrifices to be made, but relationships are never easy. But I am definitely
                willing to make them for you.

                Looking back at the last 2 years, I have to say that there were one of the 
                happiest periods of my life. When we first started, I was really drawn to the
                fact that you were an independent woman who does not need constant attention. 
                While I always joked that this has changed since then, I do not mind it much,
                afterall how can someone dislike the fact that there is someone out there always
                thinking about him and waiting for his reply. And once again, I have to apologise
                for being such an unresponsive jerk... But please be assured, I am just at home 
                either coding or watching videos. Your boyfriend has a very boring lifestyle.
            </p>

                I will never forget the time you cried when I was 
                suffering from a severe eczema attack. While I was also pretty scared at the time,
                your reaction really left a deep impression on me. It made me realize that I now
                have someone else I need to take care of (besides myself), and I cannot afford to 
                be that careless anymore. I promise you that I would take better care of myself.
                I will use the time now to start exercising more, and try (I try la!) to eat healthier.

                Our trip to Japan was really fun and memorable! Even though I had been there so many
                times, I am glad that I could experience so many firsts with you - such as the time
                we went to NintendoWorld and Harry Potter world, feeding the deers at Nara Park, and
                visiting the
                osaka light show. Truth be told, I had a really sad emotion bubbling up inside me on
                our second last day. I really wanted to spend more time with you given that you are
                going back to Australia soon. But I told myself that this trip would be the first of
                many, and that we would go on another trip soon.  
            </p>

                Dear, that's all I have to say for now. We will still be seeing each other daily (via 
                Phone), and I will always look forward to your visits and my travels over. And sorry
                for the poor design, I had to rush this out, but I will make a photo collage of our
                experience together soon. I love you, dear. We will make it - Together!
